# Cross Chain

The cross chain (XM) SDKs help you create payloads to interact with other blockchains from DEMOS. These SDKs are divided into 2:

1. Web SDKs - For use in a browser environment
2. Local SDKs - For use in a Node JS environment

Under the hood, both these SDKs extend a core SDK that contains common functionality.
