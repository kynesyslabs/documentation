# Setting up the repository

The first step is to clone and set up the Demos node repository.

Clone it with:

`git clone https://github.com/kynesyslabs/node`

Then navigate into the directory:

`cd node`

Before installing any dependencies, make sure you're on the correct branch:

* **Main branch**: stick with `main` to work with stable features â€” the same powering the nodes listed at [https://status.demos.sh](https://status.demos.sh).
* **Testnet branch**: switch to `testnet` if you want to test the latest features (and deal with the bugs that come with them). Only recommended if you've been instructed to, or if you enjoy living dangerously.
