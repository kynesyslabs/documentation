# Unparalleled Scalability

#### Dynamic Shard Composition

* **Why:** Traditional static node participation in blockchains can lead to congestion and increased transaction costs.
  * **Example:** Bitcoinâ€™s fixed node structure results in slow transaction processing during peak times, leading to higher fees for users. PoR-BFT's dynamic shard composition ensures efficient resource distribution by rotating nodes within each shard based on a pseudorandom seed generated by the CVSA.

#### Parallel Block Validation

* **Why:** Parallel block validation enhances transaction throughput while maintaining decentralization.
  * **Example:** In Ethereum, the linear scalability model causes network congestion and high gas fees during heavy usage periods. PoR-BFT's parallel block validation mechanism allows for concurrent processing of multiple transactions within a shard through optimized mathematical algorithms.
